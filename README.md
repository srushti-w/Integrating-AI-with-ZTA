## Project Overview

Traditional perimeter-based security models are increasingly ineffective in countering sophisticated cyber threats. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) operates under the principle of "never trust, always verify," offering a robust alternative. This project focuses on integrating AI into ZTA frameworks to address modern cybersecurity challenges such as anomaly detection, real-time threat analysis, and automated responses.

## Objectives

1. Develop AI models for accurate threat detection in network traffic.
2. Integrate AI with ZTA principles, emphasizing continuous authentication and dynamic access control.
3. Enable real-time threat analysis with minimal latency.
4. Optimize the system for scalability and adaptability to diverse network environments.

## Key Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based detection of suspicious activities in network traffic.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Streamlined pipelines for live data processing.
- **Dynamic Access Control**: Adaptive security policies driven by AI models.
- **Integration with ZTA Principles**: Application of continuous monitoring and least privilege access.
